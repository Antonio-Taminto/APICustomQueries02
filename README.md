write a Spring Boot application with the necessary dependencies that:
  - uses the same entity and repository as Custom Queries 1 exercise
  - has a FlightController:
    - mapped on flights
    - for the provisioning of n flights (where n is an optional query param; if absent, n=100):
      - all the string values are randomly generated (using random.ints())
      - the status is generated randomly
    - for retrieving all the flights in the db using pagination and returning them in ascending order by fromAirport
    - for retrieving all the flights that are ONTIME without using a custom query
    - for retrieving - using a custom query - all the flights that are in p1 or in p2 status
      -consider that the user has to pass p1 and p2 as parameters to the GET request
    
test the endpoints with Postman/Swagger:
  - for provisioning without the n query parameter
  - for provisioning with the n query parameter, with value 49
  - for getting the flights using pagination
  - for getting the flights that are ONTIME
  - for getting the delayed or cancelled flights
  - for getting the on time or delayed flights
